<p><strong>Scale Deep!</strong> Many entrepreneurs get turned off evolving their impact and their own natural growth path because they have witnessed too many large scale promotional campaigns. They feel like growing their business must involve trying to become huge.</p>

<p>That's just not the case. You can grow with integrity and stimulate your creativity by scaling deep.</p>

<p>I know what it's like to feel daunted by the thought of  relying on heavy promoting in order to reach the next level of growth and development.</p>

<p>Business growth needs to be personal and based on the real value you deliver. When you gain a deep understanding of what you can offer, recognize how people want to receive your services or products and choose one project that you feel excited to implement it's much easier.</p>

<p>My <strong>Scaling Deep Program</strong> is designed to help you with all that and more!</p>

<p>When I signed up for Scaling Deep I was trying to figure out which way to begin delivering my expertise beyond one-to-one training. I was hoping for clarity in what to do. Initially I was thinking of a lower priced membership model.</p>

<p>I've also decided to test the new program with a small group of people at an intro price and take them through it and get feedback and do a bigger launch the next time.</p>

<p>One of the things I took away from the program is putting up a sales page where I can see if the interest is there for the program I want to offer and see what the responses are like.</p>

<p>The worksheets provided in the course were really valuable and helped me solidify what this actually looks like. Lisa provided the right questions for me to figure out what I needed to apply in own unique situation.</p>

<p>As booked as they want to be with one-on-one clients and motivated by <strong><em>freedom to choose</em></strong> how to live and work meaningfully. Does that sound like you?

<p>You are most likely attracted to being an industry <strong><em>leader</em></strong> and are stalling because you don’t understand how you can scale in a way that feels authentic to your values and brand.</p>

<p>You are probably not interested in mimicking the mass marketers and feeling overworked trying to keep up. Are you excited to <strong><em>create and connect consciously</em></strong>?</p>

<p>When I began Scaling Deep, I had plans to offer my own online group program. Scaling Deep appealed to me because I knew it would give me the time to focus and provide me with feedback on my idea.</p>

<p>The worksheets helped me tremendously because they got my ideas out of my head and onto paper. Months later I still go back to them to help me focus on what I am creating. When I know I’m starting to go off on tangents and get distracted about what everyone else is doing, they help me get back to the core of what I need to do.</p>

<p>I pulled a lot of the language I’m using now from those exercises.</p>

<p>In addition, spending time on our values and strengths and what it is we are uniquely doing allowed me to more easily connect the dots on how I should be best serving clients.</p>

<p>The work I did in Scaling Deep helped me to realize how important it is for my own clients to know what their core message is and how much it influences what they should be talking about in their business. Because of my own reflecting on my assets and experiences, my natural areas of curiosity, I’m helping my clients weave even more of their past stories into their presentations and business brand.</p>

<p>I love working with impact-driven entrepreneurs to find true clarity, true clients and true wealth. I am a trained business strategist and coach and I believe that focusing on creating value and being in service to customers is the winning combination for success.</p>

<p>I am a results-oriented, deep thinker who has a knack for "seeing" the value every business offers and turning that into a pipeline of new offers and new clients.</p> 

<p>I created Scaling Deep because busy entrepreneurs get "stuck" in business models that aren't functioning optimally. They grow using a reactive approach instead of creating a well-designed well thought through brand. There is simply too much value and opportunities being left at the table. Join us to change your reality and grow your love for what you do.</p>

                  <h3>Does my private practice need to be full to take this program?</h3>
<p>I love working with impact-driven entrepreneurs to find true clarity, true clients and true wealth. I am a trained business strategist and coach and I believe that focusing on creating value and being in service to customers is the winning combination for success.</p>

<h3>I already know what I'm building, will this program help me?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! We are going to cover the how your business model will look in one module. The rest of it will be a deeper dive into how you deliver your best value, and how the people you serve receive transformation. When opening up to scaling, you need to know all of this information in as much detail as possible. This program will give you that opportunity. </p>

<h3>I'm interested but not sure I'm ready to scale.</h3>
<p>That depends on how you learn. This program is an exploratory model. You will still get a tonne of value out of it without having an active plan to launch something new. It will help you formulate future plans and feel confident that you will continue to evolve your offer as your customers grow in their journey.</p>

<h3>I'm too busy to dedicate time to this!</h3>
<p>Think of this as an opportunity to put focused energy to working "on" your business instead of just "in" your business. If you don't do it now, when are you ever going to create freedom in your life? I have designed this course as bite-sized actionable learning for busy entrepreneurs. All that is required is 1.5 hours per week including our weekly call.</p>

<h3>What if I can't make every call? </h3>
<p>No worries. We have you covered. Obviously it will be ideal to attend each Q&A call to get live coaching; however, each call will be recorded so you can see how everyone else is applying the tools. Plus there will be a private discussion group to get additional feedback and questions answered.</p>

<h3>Will this program teach me how to launch a course?</h3>
<p>You will definitely learn the foundation required in order to launch an online course. There are a MILLION online courses out there teaching people how to market their online courses. In most of those they are putting the cart before the horse. This is going to different. Most of those courses don't work because they assume the participants are set up for success and many actually don't. In this program we'll start talking about how to launch what you create when you know that what you are creating is set-up for success.</p>

<p>I went into the program needing to monetize the group of entrepreneurial moms that I had already cultivated but I wasn’t sure how. I had a complicated view of how to do it.</p>

<p>Through the course and having conversations with the group, I was able to add elements of co-op models that I valued and bring them into my for profit membership structure. I got clarity around my business model, of what I was offering and ideas on how to launch the program.</p>

<p>It was very valuable for me to sit in the group and talk through my challenges. At first I didn’t want to change my original idea but after absorbing others feedback, I did.</p>

<p>I also came to the realization that I am good at some things and not good at other things. One of the exercises pointed out my quicksand activities which at first I resisted, but then I came to the conclusion that if I am not good at something than I need to hire it out.
</p>
<p>Another direct takeaway included using a lot of the questions Lisa asked to create the copy for my sales page. It made it easier to do and I felt better about putting it out there.</p>
